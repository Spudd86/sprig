The SDL Primitive Generator, SPriG, is a free and open source C/C++ library that does three main things:
  * Draws graphics primitives (pixels, lines, circles, polygons, etc.) with optional anti-aliasing, alpha-blending, arbitrary thickness, and dirty rect support.
  * Rotates, scales, and mirrors SDL surfaces with optional anti-aliasing and alpha-blending.
  * Makes working with SDL surfaces quicker and easier.
